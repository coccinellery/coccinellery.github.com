This is a gallery of semantic patches for use with Coccinelle
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/). They are extracted automatically from a
collection of semantic patches that have been used to create patches for the
Linux Kernel and other software. The descriptions are derived from the commit
messages contained in those patches. There is no guarantee that the
descriptions are correct or understandable, and no guarantee that the semantic
patches are correct, complete, or work with the latest version of Coccinelle.
Comments and corrections may be sent to the Coccinelle mailing list:
cocci@systeme.lip6.fr / https://systeme.lip6.fr/mailman/listinfo/cocci.

To propose new semantic patches to be added to the gallery, please make a pull
request (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) via Github to
Coccinellery repository (https://github.com/coccinelle/coccinellery). When
adding new semantic patches, please create a folder for you under the CONTRIB
directory. Detailed instructions on the README file of the CONTRIB directory.

The semantic patches are licensed under the permissive ISC license. More info
